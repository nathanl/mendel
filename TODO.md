# TODO

- Return a lazy enumerator
- Make it possible to dump/load state of combiner
- Benchmark!
- Have a rake task that runs through some combination scenarios (2 lists only) and draws the progress through the grid. Eg, start with items drawn on the axes but nothing in the middle, put a numeric value on a coordinate when its score is calculated. (Maybe output an HTML/jQuery animation?)
- Have a `rake console` command - see Ernie Miller's blog
